<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://emkc.org">Engineer Man Knowledge Center</a> is a web
platform that hosts programming contests, challenges and user-created
snippets. This repository is a fork of the <a
href="https://github.com/engineer-man/emkc">original EMKC
repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="brief-description-of-the-functionalities">Brief description of
the functionalities</h2>
<ul>
<li>Users can create and log into their accounts on the platform using
their Discord accounts (OAuth2)</li>
<li>Challenges can be created (access control mechanisms will be
discussed later)</li>
<li>Users can submit solutions to active challenges</li>
<li>Users can see other users challenge solutions if they have solved
the same challenge</li>
<li>Contests can be created (access control mechanisms will be discussed
later)</li>
<li>Users can submit solutions to active contests</li>
<li>After a contest ends, users can see other submissions</li>
<li>Users can create snippets</li>
<li>Users can see their snippets and other users’ snippets</li>
<li>Users can see their profile and achievements</li>
<li>Discord messages on EngineerMan’s server are logged into the
database</li>
<li>Successful code executions on the external code execution API
(Piston) are logged</li>
<li>The platform also acts as a proxy to the Piston code execution API
that implements rate-limiting</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="implemented-security-measures">Implemented security
measures</h1>
<h2 id="security-measures-that-have-already-existed">Security measures
that have already existed</h2>
<h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integrating with Discord for log in is done using the <a
href="https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-oauth-2">OAuth2
protocol</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="authorization-and-access-control">Authorization and access
control</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>There are users with different authorities: staff members, normal
users, users with unlimited code execution requests per second, users
with internal api keys (usually bots).</p>
<ul>
<li>The authorities of each role are defined in
<code>src/platform/config/policies.js</code></li>
<li>Staff members can do things like: managing challenges/contests,
revalidating submissions in contests (after, for example, adding new
test cases) and logging in as other users (for troubleshooting)</li>
<li>Users (bots) with internal API keys can log Discord messages sent on
Engineer Man’s Discord server to the database and can log code
executions to the database</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Users can see other users challenge solutions only if they have
solved the same challenge</p>
<ul>
<li><code>src/platform/api/controllers/ChallengesController.js:420</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Users can only see their own submissions while a contest is
active, and can see other submissions once the contest is done</p>
<ul>
<li>The API does not return the submissions of other users while the
contest is active (both backend and frontend ensuring)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Users can only edit snippets that they have created</p>
<ul>
<li><code>src/platform/api/controllers/SnippetsController.js:119</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sql-injection-protection">SQL injection protection</h3>
<ul>
<li>The project uses Sequelize ORM which provides protection against SQL
injection
<ul>
<li>Sometimes vulnerabilities are discovered in Sequelize which allow
for SQL injection; but no vulnerable feature is used in the project (the
vulnerable features are reported in
<code>additional-reports/npm-audit-report.txt</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="xss-protection">XSS protection</h3>
<ul>
<li>The project uses React on the frontend which automatically sanitizes
external inputs to the DOM
<ul>
<li>Some exceptions to this are usages of
<code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code>, but this function is only used on
inputs from staff members</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-security-measures">New security measures</h2>
<h3 id="authorization-and-access-control-1">Authorization and access
control</h3>
<ul>
<li>Staff members have been separated into:
<ul>
<li>Superusers: these have permissions to do anything staff members
could do previously, in addition to (un)setting other users as staff
members, contest authors and challenge authors</li>
<li>Contest/challenge authors: these have permissions to manage
contests/challenges</li>
<li>This change allows us to get more users to help us with creating
contests and challenges without giving them access to dangerous
operations that can be done on the platform</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h3>
<ul>
<li>The following are now stored encrypted in the database using the
AES-192-CBC encryption algorithm:
<ul>
<li>Contest submissions</li>
<li>Challenge submissions</li>
<li>Discord chat messages</li>
<li>The source of code execution on the code execution API (Piston)</li>
<li>Users’ emails (they are retrieved from Discord API)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dos-protection-via-input-validation-and-error-handling">DOS
protection (via input validation and error handling)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The server could crash if the user modified the POST request of the
contest submission to submit to an invalid contest, this has been fixed
and proper error handling at that endpoint has been implemented.</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="safe-error-messages-via-input-validation-and-error-handling">Safe
error messages (via input validation and error handling)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The server leaked the name of a database column in the error message
when the user modified the POST request body of snippet creation to set
the language to ‘null’. This has been fixed, and proper error handling
has been implemented at that endpoint.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="penetration-testing">Penetration testing</h1>
<h2 id="simulated-attacks-using-a-nodejs-script">Simulated attacks using
a Nodejs script</h2>
<p>The <code>attacks/attacks.js</code> simulates the following attacks
on the website:</p>
<h3 id="xss-attack">XSS attack</h3>
<p>The script, as a superuser, creates a challenge that contains an XSS
injected unsafe form. This vulnerability has not been addressed since,
as we discussed, the challenges are typically created by trusted
individuals.</p>
<h3 id="viewing-a-future-contest-as-an-unauthorized-user-attack">Viewing
a future contest as an unauthorized user attack</h3>
<p>The script, as a superuser, creates a contest that starts in the
future. The script then, as a normal user, accesses this contest using
its link and is successful in doing so. This has not been addressed for
convenience. We usually like to receive feedback from certain users on
future contests so we send them the future contest link and let them
access it. Other users usually won’t be able to access that future
contest since they do not have the link (security through
obscurity).</p>
<h3
id="viewing-a-draft-challenge-as-an-unauthorized-user-attack">Viewing a
draft challenge as an unauthorized user attack</h3>
<p>The script, as a superuser, creates a “draft” challenge which only
superusers/challenge authors are supposed to see. The script then, as a
normal user, accesses this challenge using its link and is successful in
doing so. This has not been addressed for similar reasons to the
contests attack. Also, currently, accessing a draft challenge is not a
critical security vulnerability since drafts exist for allowing
challenge authors to continue working on the challenge later.</p>
<h3 id="exposing-a-database-column-attack">Exposing a database column
attack</h3>
<p>The script, as a normal user, creates a POST request to the snippet
creation endpoint with a null language. The server, as a result,
responds with the error from the database which includes a column name
in the snippets table. This has been addressed as mentioned above.</p>
<h3 id="dos-attack">DOS attack</h3>
<p>The script, as a normal user, creates a POST request to the contest
submission endpoint with an invalid contest id. The server, as a result,
does not handle this and crashes. This has been addressed as mentioned
above.</p>
<h2 id="determining-vulnerable-npm-packages">Determining vulnerable npm
packages</h2>
<p>The <code>npm audit</code> command has been run and a report
containing npm packages that have security vulnerabilities has been
generated at: <code>additional-reports/npm-audit-report.txt</code></p>
<h2 id="automated-penetration-testing-via-zap">Automated penetration
testing via ZAP</h2>
<p>The ZAP penetration testing tool has been used to perform automated
penetration testing and a report has been generated at:
<code>additional-reports/zap-report.pdf</code></p>
<h1
id="recommendations-for-improving-the-applications-security">Recommendations
for improving the application’s security</h1>
<ul>
<li>If more challenge/contest authors are to be added (those who are not
necessarily in our trust network), then sanitization needs to be done on
inputs to <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code>.</li>
<li>If future contests are to become critically secret, then access
control should be implemented on future contests to only allow contest
authors and superusers to access them. Similarly with draft challenges
and challenge authors.</li>
<li>Update the NPM dependencies to their latest versions to avoid
security vulnerabilities that may exist in older versions.</li>
<li>Use modern alternative to obsolete npm packages such as moment</li>
<li>In addition to handling errors at each controller action, global
error handling with proper logging should be implemented to avoid server
crashes in unexpected cases.</li>
<li>Unit tests, integration tests, system tests and penetration tests
should be employed to test all edge cases and achieve code
coverage.</li>
<li>Consider using Typescript instead of Javascript to ensure
type-safety and to catch type errors at compile time.</li>
<li>Consider assigning a challenge author and a contest author to each
challenge and contest to audit and trace who created that challenge or
contest.</li>
</ul>
