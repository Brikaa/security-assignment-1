mod_inverse(e, phi_n)
  - gcd(e, phi_n) is 1
  - x, y = extended_euclidean(e, phi_n, 1)
  - e * x + phi_n * y = 1

- Why does euclidean algorithm work?
  - gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b % a)
    - The greatest common divisor of a, b where a < b
      is the greatest common divisor of (the remainder of b/a), a
